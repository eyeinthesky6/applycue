# Mode: pipeline — URL Inbox (Second Brain)

Process job URLs stored in `data/pipeline.md`. The user adds URLs at any time and then executes `/applycue pipeline` to process them all.

When the current conversation makes clear that a URL came directly from the user, treat it as **high stakes** unless they said standard. Scanner-written entries remain standard. Carry the priority through review and CV preparation, then persist it through `job-feedback.mjs` once the role has a job number. Do not guess that an old unattributed inbox row was manually supplied.

## Liveness sweep

**Run this before processing any URLs.** Entries added by the scanner in headless/batch mode carry `**Verification:** unconfirmed (batch mode)` because Playwright was unavailable at scan time — they were never checked for liveness. Without a sweep, dead postings reach evaluation one tab at a time, burning time and tokens on phantom roles (a single inbox of 8 stale URLs produces 8 wasted evaluations).

Sweep all pending URLs in one batch with the zero-token liveness checker before the per-URL loop:

1. Collect every `- [ ]` URL from the "Pending" section into a temp file (one URL per line).
2. Run `node check-liveness.mjs --file <tmpfile>` (add `--throttle` for large batches to stay under WAF rate limits; it's pure Playwright, zero Claude tokens). The checker prints a per-URL verdict and exits non-zero if any are expired/uncertain.
3. For every URL the checker reports as **expired/closed**, resolve the pipeline entry instead of processing it: move it to "Processed" as `- [x] ~~URL | Company | Role~~ — posting expired (liveness sweep)` and, if it already has a tracker row, mark it `Discarded`. **Do not** extract the JD, evaluate, or generate a report/PDF for it.
4. Leave `uncertain` results in place to be confirmed during normal per-URL extraction (a transient timeout shouldn't drop a possibly-live posting).
5. Only the surviving live URLs continue to the per-URL processing loop below.

This complements — does not replace — the per-URL liveness gate in `auto-pipeline` (Step 0.5) and the `apply` preflight: the sweep drops the dead postings up front, in bulk, so the user never opens a tab or spends a token on them.

## Workflow

1. **Read** `data/pipeline.md` → search for `- [ ]` items in the "Pending" section. Run the **Liveness sweep** (above) first and drop any expired entries before continuing.
2. **For each surviving pending URL**:
   a. Claim the next sequential `REPORT_NUM` atomically by running `node reserve-report-num.mjs` (and release the sentinel using `node reserve-report-num.mjs --release <num>` after the report is written)
   b. **Extract JD** using Playwright (browser_navigate + browser_snapshot) → WebFetch → WebSearch
   c. If the URL is not accessible → mark as `- [!]` with a note and continue
   d. **Execute full auto-pipeline**: A-G review → agent `apply|watch|skip` decision → Report .md → PDF/DOCX only for `apply` → Tracker
   e. **Move from "Pending" to "Processed"**: `- [x] #NNN | URL | Company | Role | Decision | Rank | PDF ✅/❌`

   **Artifact gate:** Semantic fit scores do not control this flow. Prepare the CV/application bundle for `apply`. Keep `watch` and `skip` report-only unless the user asks. After all viable roles are reviewed, compare the `apply` queue and assign explicit ranks before presenting the shortlist.
3. **If there are 3+ pending URLs**, launch agents in parallel (Agent tool with `run_in_background`) to maximize speed — at most one agent per pending URL. Each is a **single-pass worker**: it evaluates its one URL and must **not** spawn further subagents or invoke other skills; its company/comp research stays inline and bounded (see `modes/_shared.md` → Subagent delegation). This keeps a pipeline run from fanning out into a recursive agent swarm.
4. **At the end**, show summary table:

```
| Rank | Company | Role | Decision | Confidence | PDF | Reason |
```

Pending lines are variable-width. The rawest form is a bare pasted URL,
`- [ ] {url}` (1 column) — what you drop into the inbox by hand. Scanner-written
entries add `| {company} | {title}` (3 columns) plus two optional trailing
columns: `| {location}` (4th) and `| {compensation}` (5th). The scanner fills the
trailing columns only when the ATS exposes them, so 1-, 3-, 4-, and 5-column rows
are all valid — `{url} | {company} | {title} | {location} | {compensation}` is the
maximum (canonical) shape, not the only one. The columns are positional, so a row
carrying compensation always includes the location cell (empty if unknown); a row
with only a location stays 4 columns. Existing shorter rows remain valid and are
read as having empty values for the missing trailing columns.

## Intelligent JD detection from URL

1. **Playwright (preferred):** `browser_navigate` + `browser_snapshot`. Works with all SPAs.
2. **WebFetch (fallback):** For static pages or when Playwright is unavailable.
3. **WebSearch (last resort):** Search in secondary portals that index the JD.

**Special cases:**
- **LinkedIn**: May require login → mark `[!]` and ask the user to paste the text
- **PDF**: If the URL points to a PDF, read it directly with the Read tool
- **`local:` prefix**: Read the local file. Example: `local:jds/linkedin-pm-ai.md` → read `jds/linkedin-pm-ai.md`

## Automatic numbering

1. Run `node reserve-report-num.mjs` to claim the next sequential number (stdout returns `{###}`).
2. Write the report file using that number.
3. Release the sentinel by running `node reserve-report-num.mjs --release {###}` once the report is written.

## Source synchronization

Before processing any URL, verify sync:
```bash
node cv-sync-check.mjs
```
If there is a desynchronization, warn the user before continuing.
